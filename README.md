HuggingFace Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/medreasoning-lab/README

**TokenLens-Lite** is a lightweight, open-source toolkit for analyzing transformer
models at the **token level**. It enables:

- 🔍 **Attention visualization** (per layer, per head, per token)
- 📈 **Hidden-state trajectory plots** across layers
- ✂️ **KV-cache pruning evaluation** with probability-shift metrics
- ⚡ Clean PyTorch + HuggingFace-based implementation

This project is created and maintained by **Vedant Malik** under **MedReasoning Lab**  
as an accessible interpretability toolkit for researchers and practitioners.
